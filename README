Persistent Character: A module for Factorio

Primarily, this mod prevents characters from disappearing on logout.
This results in characters lying about without associated players.

Consequently, this mod tracks said idle characters for later use. By
default, idle characters are shared with the rest of the team. Players may
leave behind an unshared character by disabling their share setting.

To switch characters, mouse over an idle character and hit the switch key
(CTRL+SPACE by default). Players who join the game will be attached to any
available character, or otherwise respawned.
